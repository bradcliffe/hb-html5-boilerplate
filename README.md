# HTML5 Boilerplate for Harp

----
## Quick Start

The bulk of HTML5 Boilerplate has been converted into `_layout.jade` to wrap your Harp site. Inside the `<head>` element, the `<title>` tag has been modified to evaluate to one of two values from `_data.json', either the `siteTitle` attribute or a `pageTitle` attribute specifically defined for a page.

**Happy building!**
