# HTML5 Boilerplate v5.0.0 for Harp

The bulk of the original boilerplate's `index.html` has been converted into `_layout.jade` to wrap your Harp site. Inside the `<head>` element, the `<title>` tag has been modified to evaluate to one of two values from `_data.json`, either the `siteTitle` attribute or a `pageTitle` attribute specifically defined for a page.

**Happy building!**
